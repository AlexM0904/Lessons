		<h3>Personality</h3>
		<div class="text">
			<p>
				His personality was reflected in the products he created. Just as the core of Apple’s philosophy, from
				the
				original <mark>Macintosh</mark> in 1984 to the iPad a generation later, was the end-to-end integration
				of
				hardware and
				software, so too was it the case with Steve Jobs: His <span style="color:blue">passions, perfectionism,
					demons,
					desires, artistry, devilry, and obsession</span> for control were integrally connected to his
				approach
				to
				business
				and the products that
				resulted.
			</p>

			<p>
				The unified field theory that ties together Jobs’s personality and products begins with his most salient
				trait:
				his intensity. His silences could be as searing as his rants; he had taught himself to stare without
				blinking.
				Sometimes this intensity was charming, in a geeky way, such as when he was explaining the profundity of
				Bob
				Dylan’s music or why whatever product he was unveiling at that moment was the most amazing thing that
				Apple
				had
				ever made. At other times it could be terrifying, such as when he was fulminating about Google or
				Microsoft
				ripping off Apple.
			</p>
			<p>
				This intensity encouraged a binary view of the world. Colleagues referred to the hero/shithead
				dichotomy.
				You
				were either one or the other, sometimes on the same day. The same was true of products, ideas, even
				food:
				Something was either “the best thing ever,” or it was shitty, brain-dead, inedible. As a result, any
				perceived
				flaw could set off a rant. The finish on a piece of metal, the curve of the head of a screw, the shade
				of
				blue
				on a box, the intuitiveness of a navigation screen—he would declare them to “completely suck” until that
				moment
				when he suddenly pronounced them “absolutely perfect.” He thought of himself as an artist, which he was,
				and
				he
				indulged in the temperament of one.
			</p>
			<h5>Excerpt 2</h5>

			<p>For Jobs, belief in an integrated approach was a matter of righteousness. “We do these things not because
				we
				are
				control freaks,” he explained. “We do them because we want to make great products, because we care about
				the
				user, and because we like to take responsibility for the entire experience rather than turn out the crap
				that
				other people make.” He also believed he was doing people a service: “They’re busy doing whatever they do
				best,
				and they want us to do what we do best. Their lives are crowded; they have other things to do than think
				about
				how to integrate their computers and devices.”</p>

			<h6>The last paragraph</h6>

			<p>This approach sometimes went against Apple’s short-term business interests. But in a world filled with
				junky
				devices, inscrutable error messages, and annoying interfaces, it led to astonishing products marked by
				beguiling
				user experiences. Using an Apple product could be as sublime as walking in one of the Zen gardens of
				Kyoto
				that
				Jobs
				loved, and neither experience was created by worshipping at the altar of openness or by letting a
				thousand
				flowers
				bloom. Sometimes it’s nice to be in the hands of a control freak.</p>

			Jobs’s intensity was also evident in his ability to focus. He would set priorities, aim his laser attention
			on them, and filter out distractions. If something engaged him—the user interface for the original
			Macintosh, the design of the iPod and iPhone, getting music companies into the iTunes Store—he was
			relentless. But if he did not want to deal with something—a legal annoyance, a business issue, his cancer
			diagnosis, a family tug—he would resolutely ignore it. That focus allowed him to say no. He got Apple back
			on track by cutting all except a few core products. He made devices simpler by eliminating buttons, software
			simpler by eliminating features, and interfaces simpler by eliminating options.
